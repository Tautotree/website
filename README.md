## Tautotree

#### Objective
Help corporate offices achieve CSR goals by improving tree adoption and urban forestry by gamifying public participation of increasing the green cover of our land.


#### Problem
* Air pollution index in cities are rising at an alarming rate
* 90% of the worldâ€™s population live where air quality levels do not meet WHO standards
* Planting more trees are more important than ever before
* Unfortuately planting and maintaining trees are either seen as a chore / luxury

#### Solution
* Companies should spend a minimum of 2% of their average net profit for its immediately preceding 3 financial years for CSR
	* An annual turnover of Rs. 1,000 crore
	-   Net worth of 500 crore or more
	-   Net profit of 5 crore or more
* Gamification - Tree adoption by minting the trees as NFT 
- Tradable nature of NFT provides opportunity to gamified scarcity
- Every tree adopted / planted through our platform bears the mark of the CSR footprint - The marketing reach of the corporate bears a physical presence
- The app shows location of the trees minted as NFT, drives the CSR footprint in the digital / metaspace too
- The trees minted as NFT - used as wayspots similar to Pokemon Go for a location based real world adventure game
- Eg. activites the game gives out
	- Hit 10 trees within a span of 100m and submit a proof that it is hydrated
	- Mark trees that are wilted out / diseased
	- Manure a near by tree that is diseased
- The game is free to play and in-game events will be conducted based on coporate's conditions therby involving their employees in a "plantathon" (planting + marathon)

#### Revenue Model
* A portion of 2% of CSR budget that is spent on sustainable development & green cover increase will be given to us & we can take care of the activities like plantation of new trees & adoption of exisiting ones
* The trees levied upon act as a physical marketing billboards across various places in cities with the tag of the corporate's name
* The billboards also turn digital in the game with the NFT tree locations available in a map
* Marketplace of tree NFTs available to be purchased - commision from both buyer & seller side
* The in-game items give an edge to long term honest playerbase who can have a edge above others.
	* Eg. Exchange fiat currency / crypto for free NFT slots
	* Create activity for the community to take care of trees that are farther away


#### Future
* Tracablity of farm to plate industry with blockchain - commision from orchid owners and investors 
* Tautotree as a platform will be able to extend to write new applications from the tree data stored in the blockchain
	* Eg. Bingo like game with NFT Trees in the matrix display
	* Eg. Supply chain traceability of road side tamarind trees that are leased to particular 3rd party
* Automation of tree adoption & maintainace throught IOT sprinklers and manure sprayers
* Marketplace to buy tree adoption related IOT hardware
* Metaverse of tree NFTs opens roadways to more gaming capability

#### Our efforts
* We are looking for the long term plan and we have patented our idea & architecture of NFT based Blockchain orchids (Status pending)
* We are sprinting towards a MVP and also refining ideas further by talking to potential stakeholders and mentors
* Our vision, mission can be realized only by a strong revenue model and we are open-minded to discuss further & would be amazing if we could collaborate with the Govt. too.
